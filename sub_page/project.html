		<p style="color: #FF0000; font-size: 20px; font-family: Comic Sans MS"> With the purpose of collect more information about the structure of fish
communities at the estuaries and mangrove forests that needed to manage and use these
natural resources more effectively and sustainably. This study was conducted at the
largest estuary and mangrove forest in northern Vietnam, from March 2018 to February
2019 and targeted mainly on larval and juvenile fish. We employed a larval net monthly
at the midstream of Ba Lat estuary of the Red River and tidal creeks of Xuan Thuy
National Parkâ€™s mangrove forest. A total of 18,509 individuals of larval and juvenile
fish were collected and identified to the lowest taxon as possible. The physical features
of water environment were also recorded. We recorded 78 species or type of fish that
belong to 34 families/subfamilies and 14 orders. In which, numerically, Gobiopterus
sp. was the most abundant, followed by Ambassis vachelli, Clupeiformes sp.,
Omobranchus sp., Gobidae sp.1 and Gobidae sp.2. The mean density of fish peaked in
the month of May and at XL6 station, divided by time and sampling stations
respectively. The number of fish species was highest in July when calculated by time,
and at the station XL7 when calculated by sampling stations. The roles of mangrove
forests and the estuary were discussed in the relation to distribution pattern of fish.</p>
