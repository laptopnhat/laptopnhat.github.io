	<h2><p>Current Interest</p></h2>
	<p> Sweetfish, <i>Plecoglossus altivelis</i> (or <i>Ayu</i> in Japanese) is a amphidromous fish (fish that migrate between sea and freshwater) and is very imortant species not only in commercial market but also important for the ECOSYSTEM where the species inhabits. It is distributed over the Japanese Archipelagoes, Korean Penusuala, Chinese Coast and the north of Vietnam. <br>Under negative effects of global warming, overfishing, environmental degradation, ect., many populations of this species has been extincted (for example: Ryukyu-ayu on Okinawa Island of Japan; Ayu in Taiwan), others are serevely dcreasing (for example: Ryukyu-ayu population on Amami-oshima Island; ayu population in Vietnam). Therefore more knowledge about this important species is urgently needed for conserving this species in the nature. Our lab is focusing on clarifying the geographical variation of populations from the temprate to subtropical area, the adaptation process of the species to novel environmental conditions (such as lacutrine conditions), genetic diversity and genetic structure of populations.</br></p>
